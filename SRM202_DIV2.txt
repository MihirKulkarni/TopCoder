Problem Statement
    
    A letter-string is composed of letters ('A'-'Z','a'-'z') and dashes ('-'). The length of a 
    letter-string is the number of characters in it not including dashes (in other words, the number 
    of letters in the string). Given a list of letter-strings you will return the sum of their lengths.  
    Create a class LetterStrings that contains the method sum, which takes a String[], s, and returns 
    an int representing the sum of the lengths of the given letter-strings.
    
{"-"}
Returns: 0

{"-----Abc"}
Returns: 3

{"-A-B-C-D", "--------EFGHI", "JKLMNOPQR", "---STU-VW-XYZ"}
Returns: 26


public class LetterStrings {
	public static int sum(String[] s) {
		int cnt = 0;
		
		for (String str : s) {
			for (char c : str.toCharArray())
				if (c != '-') cnt ++;
		}
		
		return cnt;
	}
}
