Problem Statement
    
    In soccer leagues, the winner of a match is awarded with 3 points and the loser 0 points. In 
    case of a tie, both teams are awarded with 1 point each.
    Create a class Soccer containing the method maxPoints which takes a int[] wins, the number of 
    wins for each team in the league, and a int[] ties, the number of ties for each team in the 
    league and returns an int, the maximum points a team in the league has. The i'th elements of wins 
    and ties correspond to the number of wins and ties respectively for team i.
    
    
{1,4,3,0,0}
{3,1,5,3,1}
Returns: 14
The number of points for each team are:  Team 0: 3*1 + 1*3 = 6 points Team 1: 3*4 + 1*1 = 13 points 
Team 2: 3*3 + 1*5 = 14 points Team 3: 3*0 + 1*3 = 3 points Team 4: 3*0 + 1*1 = 1 point  So team 2 
has the most number of points, 14. The method should thus return 14.    

{12,45,20,17,48,0}
{48,10,53,94,0,100}
Returns: 145

{35,0}
{0,76}
Returns: 105

{0,0,0,0}
{0,0,0,0}
Returns: 0


public class Soccer {
		public static int maxPoints(int[] wins, int[] ties) {
		int maxPoints = -1;

		for (int i = 0; i < wins.length; i++) {
			int pts = 3 * wins[i] + 1 * ties[i];
			maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, pts);
		}

		return maxPoints;
	}
}
