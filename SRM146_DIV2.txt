Problem Statement
    
    This task is about the scoring in the first phase of the die-game Yahtzee, where five dice are 
    used. The score is determined by the values on the upward die faces after a roll. The player gets 
    to choose a value, and all dice that show the chosen value are considered active. The score is 
    simply the sum of values on active dice.
    Say, for instance, that a player ends up with the die faces showing 2, 2, 3, 5 and 4. Choosing 
    the value two makes the dice showing 2 active and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 
    makes the one die showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.
    Your method will take as input a int[] toss, where each element represents the upward face of a 
    die, and return the maximum possible score with these values.
    
    
{ 2, 2, 3, 5, 4 }
Returns: 5
The example from the text.


{ 6, 4, 1, 1, 3 }
Returns: 6
Selecting 1 as active yields 1 + 1 = 2, selecting 3 yields 3, selecting 4 yields 4 and selecting 
6 yields 6, which is the maximum number of points.

{ 5, 3, 5, 3, 3 }
Returns: 10
