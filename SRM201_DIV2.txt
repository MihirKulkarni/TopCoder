Problem Statement
    
    You are to create a class Multiples with a method number, which takes three ints: min, max, and 
    factor.
    Given a range of integers from min to max (inclusive), determine how many numbers within that 
    range are evenly divisible by factor.

public class Multiples {
	public static int number(int min, int max, int factor) {
		int cnt = 0;
		
		for (int i = min; i <= max; i++)
			if (i % factor == 0) cnt++;
		
		return cnt;
	}
}
