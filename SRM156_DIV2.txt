Problem Statement
    
    As of late, your usually high-performance computer has been acting rather sluggish. You come to 
    realize that while you have plenty of free disk space on your machine, it is split up over many 
    hard drives. You decide that the secret to improving performance is to consolidate all the data 
    on your computer onto as few hard drives as possible.
    Given a int[] used, representing the amount of disk space used on each drive, and a corresponding 
    int[] total, representing the total capacity of each drive mentioned in used, you should attempt 
    to pack the data onto as few hard drives as possible. You may assume that the data consists of 
    very small files, such that splitting it up and moving parts of it onto different hard drives 
    never presents a problem. Return the minimum number of hard drives that still contain data after 
    the consolidation is complete.
    
    
{300,525,110}
{350,600,115}
Returns: 2
In this example, the computer contains three hard drives:
Hard drive 1: 350 MB total, 300 MB used, 50 MB free
Hard drive 2: 600 MB total, 525 MB used, 75 MB free
Hard drive 3: 115 MB total, 110 MB used, 5 MB free

One way to pack the data onto as few drives as possible is as follows. First, move 50 MB from hard 
drive 3 to hard drive 1, completely filling it up. Next, move the remaining 60 MB from hard drive 3 
to hard drive 2. There are still two hard drives which contain data after this process, so your 
method should return 2.


{1,200,200,199,200,200}
{1000,200,200,200,200,200}
Returns: 1

One way to consolidate the data would be to move the 1 MB from hard drive 1 to hard drive 4. However, 
this is a poor choice, as it results in only one free hard drive and five hard drives which still 
contain data. A better decision is to move all the data from the other five hard drives onto hard 
drive 1. Now there is only one hard drive which contains data. Since this is the optimal strategy, 
the method returns 1.


{49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,
 49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49,49}
{50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,
 50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50}
Returns: 49

To consolidate this data, you would select one hard drive, and transfer 1 MB of data from it to each 
other drive. This results in 49 completely full hard drives and one empty drive.
