    except with the first character of each word capitalized.

public class TitleString {
	public static String toFirstUpperCase(String title) {
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		boolean first = true;
		
		for (char c : title.toCharArray()) {
			if (c == ' ') {
				sb.append(c);
				first = true;
			} else if (first) {
				sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(c));
				first = false;
			} else {
				sb.append(c);
