Problem Statement
    
    Even students who hate math find one calculation very useful -- what is the lowest score I can 
    get on the last test and pull out a certain grade? Let's write a program to help them minimize 
    their education.
    We will assume that an average score of 90 or higher is rewarded with an A grade, 80 or higher 
    (but less than 90) is a B, 70 or higher (but less than 80) is a C, 60 or higher (but less than 70) 
    is a D. All test scores are integers between 0 and 100 inclusive and the average is NOT rounded 
    -- for example an average of 89.99 does NOT get you an A.
    Create a class Education that contains a method minimize that is given a String desire indicating 
    the desired grade and a int[] tests containing the scores on all but the final test. The method 
    returns the lowest possible test score for the final test that will earn at least the desired grade. 
    If even a perfect score won't get the desired grade, return -1.
    The desired grade will be given as a String of length 1, either "A", "B", "C", or "D".
    
"A"
{0,70}
Returns: -1
Even a perfect 100 on the last test will only produce an average score of 56.66 so it is not possible 
to earn an A.    

"D"
{100,100,100,100,100,100}
Returns: 0
Nice scores! Even the worst possible score of 0 will give an average of 85.7 earning a B which 
satisfies your meager desire.

"B"
{80,80,80,73}
Returns: 87
An 87 added to these scores will just exactly improve your average from 78.25 to 80.

"A"
{80}
Returns: 100


public class Education {
	public static int minimize(String desire, int[] tests) {
		int sum = 0;
		double cnt = tests.length + 1;

		for (int i : tests) {
			sum += i;
		}

		if (desire.equals("A")) {
			if (sum / cnt >= 90.0)
				return 0;
			else if ((sum + 100) / cnt < 90.0)
				return -1;
			else {
				return (int) ((90.0 * cnt) - sum);
			}
		} else if (desire.equals("B")) {
			if (sum / cnt >= 80.0)
				return 0;
			else if ((sum + 100) / cnt < 80.0)
				return -1;
			else {
				return (int) ((80.0 * cnt) - sum);
			}
		} else if (desire.equals("C")) {
			if (sum / cnt >= 70.0)
				return 0;
			else if ((sum + 100) / cnt < 70.0)
				return -1;
			else {
				return (int) ((70.0 * cnt) - sum);
			}
		} else {
			if (sum / cnt >= 60.0)
				return 0;
			else if ((sum + 100) / cnt < 60.0)
				return -1;
			else {
				return (int) ((60.0 * cnt) - sum);
			}
		}
	}
}
