Problem Statement
    
    Bob and Doug have recently moved from Canada to the United States, and they are confused by this 
    strange letter, "ZEE". They need your assistance. Given a String text, replace every occurrence 
    of the word, "ZEE", with the word, "ZED", and return the result.  Note that if "ZEE" is just part 
    of a larger word (for example, "ZEES"), it should not be altered.
    

"THE TWENTY SIXTH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET IS ZEE"
Returns: "THE TWENTY SIXTH LETTER OF THE ALPHABET IS ZED"
There is precisely one occurrence of "ZEE" in this line of text, so it should be replaced with "ZED".
    
"ZEE"
Returns: "ZED"

"SPELLING IN ENGLISH IS EZEE"
Returns: "SPELLING IN ENGLISH IS EZEE"
The "ZEE" at the end of this line should not be altered since it is part of a larger word.    

"ZEE ZEE ZED ZEDS ZEE ZEES"
Returns: "ZED ZED ZED ZEDS ZED ZEES"


public class CultureShock {
	public static String translate(String text) {
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

		for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++) {
			if (i == 0 || text.charAt(i - 1) == ' ') {
				if (text.charAt(i) == 'Z') {
					if (i + 1 < text.length() && text.charAt(i + 1) == 'E') {
						if (i + 2 < text.length() && text.charAt(i + 2) == 'E') {
							if (i + 3 == text.length()
									|| (i + 3 < text.length() && text
											.charAt(i + 3) == ' ')) {
								sb.append("ZED");
								i += 2;
								continue;
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
			sb.append(text.charAt(i));
		}

		return sb.toString();
	}
