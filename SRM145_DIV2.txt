PROBLEM STATEMENT:

    Sometimes when computer programs have a limited number of colors to use, they use a technique 
    called dithering. Dithering is when you use a pattern made up of different colors such that when
    the colors are viewed together, they appear like another color. For example, you can use a 
    checkerboard pattern of black and white pixels to achieve the illusion of gray.
    You are writing a program to determine how much of the screen is covered by a certain dithered 
    color. Given a computer screen where each pixel has a certain color, and a list of all the solid
    colors that make up the dithered color, return the number of pixels on the screen that are used 
    to make up the dithered color. Each pixel will be represented by a character in screen. Each 
    character in screen and in dithered will be an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z') representing a color.
    Assume that any pixel which is a color contained in dithered is part of the dithered color.
    
    
"BW"
{"AAAAAAAA",
 "ABWBWBWA",
 "AWBWBWBA",
 "ABWBWBWA",
 "AWBWBWBA",
 "AAAAAAAA"}

Returns: 24

Here, our dithered color could consist of black (B) and white (W) pixels, composing a shade of gray. 
In the picture, there is a dithered gray square surrounded by another color (A).


"ACEGIKMOQSUWY"
{"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX",
 "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX",
 "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX",
 "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX",
 "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX",
 "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX"}
Returns: 150
A picture of vertical stripes, every other stripe is considered part of the dithered color.

    
public class ImageDithering {
	public static int count(String dithered, String[] screen) {
		int count = 0;
		
		for (String line : screen) {
			for (char c : dithered.toCharArray()) {
				int i = line.length();
				line = line.replace(String.valueOf(c), "");
				count = count + i - line.length();
			}
		}
		
		return count;
	}
}
