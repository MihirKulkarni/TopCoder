Problem Statement
    
    You are helping to develop a weblog-management system called bloggo. Although bloggo pushes all 
    content to the front end of a website in HTML, not all content authors enjoy using HTML tags in 
    their text. To make their lives easier, bloggo offers a simple syntax called shortcuts to achieve 
    some HTML textual effects. Your job is to take a document written with shortcuts and translate it 
    into proper HTML.
    One shortcut is used to make italicized text. HTML does this with the <i> and </i> tags, but in 
    bloggo, an author can simply enclose a piece of text using two instances of the underscore 
    character, '_'. Thus, where a content author writes

      You _should_ see the baby elephant at the zoo!
    bloggo will publish the following instead.

      You <i>should</i> see the baby elephant at the zoo!
    Another shortcut serves to render text in boldface, which HTML accomplishes with <b> and </b> tags. 
    Bloggo lets content authors do the same with paired instances of the asterisk character, '*'. 
    When a content author writes the text

      Move it from *Receiving* to *Accounts Payable*.
    it will end up on the website as

      Move it from <b>Receiving</b> to <b>Accounts Payable</b>.
    Given a String, text, containing zero or more usages of the italic and boldface shortcuts, 
    translate it into HTML as demonstrated by the examples above. There will be an even number of 
    underscores and of asterisks in text, respectively, and the spans of text enclosed by successive 
    pairs of these characters will not overlap. To render a span of text in italics in HTML, you must 
    start with the <i> tag and end with the </i> tag. For boldface text, start with <b> and end with 
    </b>. After rendering all shortcuts in HTML, return the resulting text as a String.
    
"Move it from *Accounts Payable* to *Receiving*."
Returns: "Move it from <b>Accounts Payable</b> to <b>Receiving</b>."
Notice that a boldface span may enclose several words.

"_now_I_know_*my*_ABC_next_time_*sing*it_with_me"
Returns: 
"<i>now</i>I<i>know</i><b>my</b><i>ABC</i>next<i>time</i><b>sing</b>it<i>with</i>me"

" _ _ __  _ yabba dabba _   *  dooooo  * ****"
Returns: " <i> </i> <i></i>  <i> yabba dabba </i>   <b>  dooooo  </b> <b></b><b></b>"
Shortcuts may enclose spaces or nothing at all.


public class bloggoShortcuts {
	public static String expand(String text) {
		StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
		boolean bold = false;
		boolean italic = false;
		
		for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
			if (c == '*') {
				sb.append(bold == true ? "</b>" : "<b>");
				bold = !bold;
			} else if (c == '_') {
				sb.append(italic == true ? "</i>" : "<i>");
				italic = !italic;
			} else
				sb.append(c);
		}
		return sb.toString();
	}
}
