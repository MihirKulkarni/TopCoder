Problem Statement
    
    You have acquired a list of the math and verbal test scores from all the children in the county. 
    Write a class Average that contains a method belowAvg that takes two int[], math and verbal, 
    representing the math and verbal scores of all of the children in the county, and returns the 
    number of children who have a composite score which is below average in the county.
    The composite score is defined to be the sum of a child's math and verbal scores.
    
{200,250,700,700}
{400,400,400,400}
Returns: 2

{293}
{799}
Returns: 0

{400,400,400,400,400,400,401}
{400,400,400,400,400,400,400}
Returns: 6


public class Average {
	public static int belowAvg(int[] math, int[] verbal) {
		int cnt = 0;
		int[] c = new int[math.length];
		double total = 0;

		for (int i = 0; i < math.length; i++) {
			c[i] = math[i] + verbal[i];
			total += c[i];
		}
		
		double avg = total / math.length;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
			if (c[i] < avg)
				cnt ++;
		}
		return cnt;
	}
}
