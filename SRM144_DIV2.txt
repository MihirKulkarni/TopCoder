PROBLEM STATEMENT:

    Computers tend to store dates and times as single numbers which represent the number of seconds 
    or milliseconds since a particular date. Your task in this problem is to write a method whatTime, 
    which takes an int, seconds, representing the number of seconds since midnight on some day, and 
    returns a String formatted as "<H>:<M>:<S>". Here, <H> represents the number of complete hours 
    since midnight, <M> represents the number of complete minutes since the last complete hour ended, 
    and <S> represents the number of seconds since the last complete minute ended. Each of <H>, <M>, 
    and <S> should be an integer, with no extra leading 0's. Thus, if seconds is 0, you should return
    "0:0:0", while if seconds is 3661, you should return "1:1:1".

public class Time {
	public String whatTime(int seconds) {
		int hrs = 0;
		int min = 0;
		int sec = 0;
		
		hrs = seconds / 3600;
		seconds = seconds - (hrs * 3600);
		min = seconds / 60;
		sec = seconds - (min * 60);
		
		return (hrs + ":" + min + ":" + sec);
